\arguments{
\item{peaks}{List of dataframes containing QTL peaks for each tissue}

\item{mapping}{List of relevant mapping information for overall project}

\item{suggLOD}{Suggestive LOD threshold. Default is 6.}

\item{outdir}{String of path to output directory where effects lists will be saved.}

\item{outfile}{Output file name to save mediation results for later use}

\item{total_cores}{Number of available cores to use. Default is NULL.}

\item{save}{Should files be saved, returned, or both. Default is "sr" (save and return). To save only use "so", to return only use "ro".}

\value{
A list containing: \itemize{
\item{effects_blup}{QTL effect BLUPs from scan along one chromosome. Output from \code{\link[qtl2:scan1blup]{qtl2::scan1blup()}}}
