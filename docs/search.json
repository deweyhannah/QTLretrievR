    "text": "Advances in molecular phenotyping technologies, including quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics (“-omics”), have transformed biomedical research over the past two decades by providing a granular understanding of the gene regulatory networks that drive disease. Many studies have demonstrated the additional power of combining -omics profiling with genetic mapping, an integrative approach referred to as “systems genetics”, to link population variability in complex disease phenotypes back to genetic variants and their direct effects on gene regulation (e.g. gene expression). However, these quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses are often computationally intensive and intimidating to those without a strong computational background — especially when samples originate from multiple cell/tissue types or involve thousands of molecular phenotypes. We have developed a new R package, QTLretrievR, that aims to simplify and streamline the identification and downstream analyses of molecular QTL from genetically diverse populations such as Diversity Outbred or Collaborative Cross mice. QTLretrievR leverages existing R packages used in complex trait analysis, including the popular qtl2 package for QTL peak calling and haplotype effect identification and the intermediate package for peak mediation, and employs dynamic nested parallelism to enhance the efficiency of each analysis step. Future developments will enhance the visualization functionality and data analysis options, including adding network inference methods and expanding the software to work with other mapping populations."
